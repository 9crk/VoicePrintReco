## Voice Print Recognition Demos  
The first 4 demos are the official demos from ALIZE, and they run on UNIX-like systems. The last demo is created by myself and it's similar to the `01_GMM-UBM_system_with_ALIZE3.0`, while it runs on Windows.

To run these demos, you need to compile the `SPro_5.0`, `ALIZE_3.0` and `LIA_RAL_3.0` in order and copy the executable files to the `bin` directory in each demo in the `Demos` directory.(if there is no `bin` directory in the demo directory like `01_GMM-UBM_system_with_ALIZE3.0` directory, you need create a `bin` directory yourself.) To compile these tools, see the INSTALL file in each of directory for more information.  

Any questions about compiling the tools and running the demos, please contact me via ibillxia AT gmail.com.
